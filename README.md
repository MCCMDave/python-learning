# Python Learning Journey

## About

This repository documents my Python learning progress during my Cloud IT Administrator certification (IHK, Germany). It contains self-developed projects that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts and practical automation skills relevant to cloud infrastructure and system administration.

## Projects

### Homelab Service Monitor ⭐

**Status:** Fully self-developed  
**Purpose:** Automated monitoring for critical homelab services (Nextcloud, Pi-hole, Tailscale)

**Features:**
- Real-time service health checks (CPU, RAM, uptime)
- Automated alarm generation for critical thresholds
- Statistical analysis and reporting
- Comprehensive German documentation
- Modular test suite included

**Technologies:** Python 3, dictionaries, file I/O, datetime  
**Files:** `homelab_service_monitor.py`, `homelab-service-test.py`

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Working with complex data structures (dictionaries)
- Function design and modularity
- Testing and validation methodologies
- Documentation best practices

**Purpose:** Feature-rich calculator with business calculations

**Features:**
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Advanced functions (square, square root)
- Business calculations (discount, markup, percentage)
- Input validation and error handling
- Clean user interface with consistent formatting

**Technologies:** Python 3, match-case statements, error handling  
**File:** `taschenrechner_v4.py`

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Control flow and conditional logic
- User input validation

### Power Savings Calculator

**Status:** Self-developed  
**Purpose:** Track solar power generation and calculate cost savings

**Features:**
- Daily power generation logging
- Automatic cost calculation based on current electricity rates
- CSV export for historical data tracking
- Automatic header generation for new files
- Input validation

**Technologies:** Python 3, CSV handling, datetime, file operations  
**File:** `Stromersparnisrechner_v1.py`

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- File operations and CSV handling
- Data persistence
- Date and time manipulation
- Practical real-world application

## Learning Context

**Program:** Cloud IT Administrator (IHK Certification)  
**Duration:** June 2025 - March 2026  
**Current Module:** 2 of 4

These projects complement my formal training by providing hands-on experience with:
- Automation scripting
- System monitoring concepts
- Data handling and persistence
- Problem-solving with code

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3.13
- **Concepts:** Functions, dictionaries, lists, file I/O, error handling
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, WSL

## Project Philosophy

All projects in this repository follow these principles:
- Write clean, readable code
- Document thoroughly (especially for learning purposes)
- Focus on practical, real-world applications
- Build incrementally with testing

## Future Plans

- Expand homelab monitoring with Pi integration
- Add automated reporting features
- Implement data visualization
- Develop backup automation scripts

## Note on Code Comments

Code comments are in German as this is primarily a learning project. This approach helps me internalize concepts in my native language while developing professional coding skills.
